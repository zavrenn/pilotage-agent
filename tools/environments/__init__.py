"""Pilotage execution environment backends.

Each backend provides the same interface (BaseEnvironment ABC) for running
shell commands in a specific execution context: local, Docker, SSH,
Singularity, Modal, Daytona, or Vercel Sandbox.

The terminal_tool.py factory (_create_environment) selects the backend
based on the TERMINAL_ENV configuration.
