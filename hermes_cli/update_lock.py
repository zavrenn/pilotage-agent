"""Cross-process mutual exclusion for in-flight Hermes updates.

Both the terminal and dashboard can start ``hermes update`` against the same
install tree. This module prevents concurrent runs from rewriting the checkout
under each other. The lock format is intentionally small and inspectable:

    <HERMES_HOME>/.hermes-update-in-progress   body: "<pid>\\n<started_at_unix>"

A marker counts as live only while its process exists and it is younger than
the age ceiling. Stale markers are removed when observed.
